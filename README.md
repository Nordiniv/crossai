# Crossai - AI Crossword Puzzles 🧩
Welcome to Crossai 🤖, a collection of interactive crossword puzzles designed to challenge your knowledge of artificial intelligence concepts. Whether you're a beginner or an expert in AI, these puzzles will test your understanding of popular frameworks and libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn, as well as key concepts in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing 📈.

## How to Play 📌
To get started, simply clone or download this repository and open any of the crossword puzzles in your favorite text editor or word processor. Each puzzle is represented as a text file, with clues and answers listed in a specific format.

To solve a clue, read the clue carefully and try to think of a word or phrase that matches the description. Then, look for the corresponding space in the crossword grid and type in the answer using uppercase letters.

If you get stuck on a clue, don't worry! You can always skip to the next one and come back to it later. And if you're really stuck, you can always check the answer key provided in each puzzle file.
